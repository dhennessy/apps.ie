## I'm a designer and I don't understand git
Send me an email ([denis@peerassembly.com](mailto:denis@peerassembly.com)) with the information you'd like in the listing and I'll create/update your listing for you. 

Note that this offer is only for designers; if you're a developer, all updates must be through GitHub pull requests.

## How do I list my Android apps?
Right now, you can't, at least not directly in the listing (but of course you'll have a link to your website where you can showcase them).

If anyone can figure out a way to cleanly display Android icons using a product id, let me know (or make the change and send me a pull request).

## Why does my listing show as 'unavailable'?
All entries which have not been updated in the last 6 months are automatically shown as unavailable. To mark it as available, just send me a pull request with the `updated` field set to todays date. You might also want to set a reminder to do that every 4 months or so.
